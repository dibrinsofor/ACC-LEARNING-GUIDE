#### How to use this curriculum

This is my multi-month study plan for going from GU noob to software engineer for a large company.

This curriculum is not gospel and for such should only be treated as a guide to help you get your feet wet. 

Try as much as possible to work on additional projects even while you follow this guide. The best way to learn is by doing.

To fork this repo, run this git command

This is meant for **new software engineers** or those interested in learning about blockchain technologies.
