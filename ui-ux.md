#### How to use this curriculum

This is my multi-month study plan for going from GU noob to software engineer for a large company.

This curriculum is not gospel and for such should only be treated as a guide to help you get your feet wet. 

Try as much as possible to work on additional projects even while you follow this guide. The best way to learn is by doing.

To fork this repo, run this git command
```
fork shit up!!!
```

This is meant for **new software engineers** or those interested in learning about user interface and user experience.

**as you complete each stage of this curriculum, mark it as done in your code editor and push that to your forked repo**

<summary>Understand the UX process</summary>

There are no strict rules. Although I’m going to give you idea of a general and common UX design process called Design Thinking.

- [ ] What is Design Thinking?
    - Design Thinking is the process of designing product from perspective how it will be understood and used my users rather than requiring users to adopt their behaviours in order to learn how to use the system. The goal is to develop useful & valuable products based on user needs, not the other way around. Design Thinking occurs in the following five stages.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg9nLNonrTM)
- [ ] 5 Stages of design thinking
    - 1. Emphasize:
The first stage of the Design Thinking is about getting to know the users, their wants, needs and objectives. This includes: observing and engaging with people their experiences and motivations, as well as immersing yourself in the physical environment so you can gain a deeper personal understanding of the issues involved. All of the insights gathered at this stage are carried over the next stages
    - 2. Define:
The second stage in the Design Thinking process is dedicated to defining the problem based on the information you have gathered during the Empathise stage. During Define stage you will analyse your observations and put them in order to define the key problems that you and your team have identified so far. Once you’ve created a problem statement you can start to progress into the third stage of Design thinking, Ideate.
    - 3. Ideate:
All of the insights from the previous stages have given you very solid foundation in the terms of understanding your users, so it’s time to generate potential solutions to the problem statement you’ve defined during the define stage. There are many different types of ideation technique that will help you to generate potential solutions and ideas: brainstorming, mindmapping, bodystorming. The main goal of this stage is to generate as many potential solutions as possible when moving to the next phase in the Design Thinking process — Prototype.
    - 4. Prototype:
The fourth step in the Design Thinking process is all about experimentation and turning ideas into tangible products. A prototype is basically a scaled-down version of the product which incorporates the potential solutions identified in the previous stages. This step is key in putting each solution to the test and highlighting any constraints and flaws. Throughout the prototype stage, the proposed solutions may be accepted, improved, redesigned or rejected depending on how they fare in prototype form.
    - 5. Test:
Testing stage is about validating the product before final developing it. This is the final stage of the 5 stage-mode, however the results generated from the testing phase will often lead you back to a previous stages of the process, providing the insights you need to improve the current built of your product and test it over again.
Design Thinking is flexible & iterative process — that means process doesn’t have to follow the steps in sequential sequential order — The 5 stages should be understood as different modes that contribute to a project. I’ve described those steps very briefly, so If you need to learn more about each particular one you should visit www.interaction-design.org
