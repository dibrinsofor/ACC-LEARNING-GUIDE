#### How to use this curriculum

This is my multi-month study plan for going from GU noob to software engineer for a large company.

This curriculum is not gospel and for such should only be treated as a guide to help you get your feet wet. 

Try as much as possible to work on additional projects even while you follow this guide. The best way to learn is by doing.

To fork this repo, run this git command
```
fork shit up!!!
```

This is meant for **new software engineers** or those interested in learning Data Science.

**as you complete each stage of this curriculum, mark it as done in your code editor and push that to your forked repo**

#### Also good to note:
- Start projects as soon as you can 
    - Use https://www.kaggle.com/ to review code and work on basic projects 
    - Beginner projects video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8igH8...
- Take notes on what algorithms and packages others use 
- Learn the source code for the algorithms and try to implement them from scratch 
- Work on more advanced projects where you collect your own data or use advanced concepts like deep learning, nlp, or computer vision.
